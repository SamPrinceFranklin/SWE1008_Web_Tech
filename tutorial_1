                pizza dough. Butter chicken is a popular dish in India, you could find
                this dish on the menu of almost all Indian restaurants. I’d already

                recipe for making this butter chicken topping. I made the gravy really
                thick so that it can be spread on the pizza dough, topped the pizza with
                red onion, red pepper and cheese.
